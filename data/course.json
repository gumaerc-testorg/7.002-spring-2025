  "course_description": "7.002 is a laboratory course that teaches fundamental skills for performing biological research. Through experiments with an *E. coli* bacterial ATPase called ClpX, you will learn essential molecular biology techniques commonly used in modern research labs. These techniques include site-directed mutagenesis, DNA isolation, molecular cloning, bacteria transformations, recombinant protein expression and purification, gel electrophoresis, and western blotting. Learning these techniques will give you a taste of life in a molecular biochemistry lab and prepare you for future research work. Our focus is on helping you integrate factual knowledge with an understanding of experimental design and data analysis.",
